## üéØ Quick Deploy (30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway
```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login to Railway
railway login

# 3. Deploy backend
cd backend
railway init
railway up

# 4. Get your backend URL
railway domain
# Copy URL: https://calpro-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-secret-here-at-least-32-chars
DB_PATH=./production.db
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
PORT=3000
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Configuration
```bash
# Update netlify.toml with your Railway URL
# Replace: https://your-backend-url.railway.app
# With: https://calpro-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend to Netlify
```bash
# Option A: Connect GitHub repo to Netlify (recommended)
# 1. Push to GitHub
# 2. Connect repo in Netlify dashboard
# 3. Set build directory: public
# 4. Deploy

# Option B: Manual deploy
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
